;1.1 - Removed the need to have menu items pre-escape the special html characters.
;1.2 - Added handling of <front> href links, now changes it to base path.
;1.3 - Seperated the xml generation from the file saving, removed the ability to save the xml file as the menu is now dyanmically generated via _menu.php
;1.4 - Added PHP version check to xml_menu_tree() to determine which version of htmlentities to use.
;1.5 - Reworked the way the value data is processed. Converts special entities into NCR types (#&[number]; format)
;1.6 - Added ability to specify custom extra data to be put out with the XML nodes via the Menu Item's description field. Also modify the Menu Item edit form.
;1.7 - Initial JSON output capability. Query string ?JS=1
;1.8 - Converted to Drupal 6.
	 - Handles the hidden property of the menu item. "Enabled" in the menu system.
;1.9 - Added node add/edit form modification so that new nodes with menu items dont cause the menu item's description to be set and cause problems.

;1.11 - Fixed missing query string from menu url's.
;1.12 - Added fourthLevelNav to the primary menu id default
;1.13 - Fixed issue where a numerical index for id in the json array will cause chrome to re-order the array. Appended letter to index to prevent it.
;1.14 - Added the output of the active menu item based on drupal's information. "isActive"
;1.15 - Added handling of "user/%" => "user" to handle the drupal menu "my account".
